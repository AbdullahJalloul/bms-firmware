# Libre Solar BMS Firmware

![build badge](https://travis-ci.com/LibreSolar/bms-firmware.svg?branch=master)

Firmware based on ARM mbed framework for the Libre Solar Battery Management Systems

## Supported devices

The firmware is configurable to support different BMS PCBs:

- Libre Solar 3-5s (12V) BMS with TI bq76920: [BMS-5S50-SC](https://github.com/LibreSolar/bms-5s50-sc)
- Libre Solar 6-15s (24-48V) BMS with TI bq76930/40: [BMS-15S80-SC](https://github.com/LibreSolar/bms-15s80-sc)

## Building and flashing the firmware

This firmware is developed using the [ARM mbed OS](https://developer.mbed.org/) embedded framework which has easy-to-understand C++ syntax (similar to Arduino) and thus enhances community based software development.

If used together with Visual Studio Code and PlatformIO, starting firmware development is only a matter of a few clicks:

1. Install Visual Studio Code and [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/platformio-ide) to build the firmware.

2. Select the correct board in `platformio.ini` by removing the comment before the board name under `[platformio]`

3. Connect the board via a programmer. See the Libre Solar website for [further project-agnostic instructions](http://libre.solar/docs/flashing).

4. Press the upload button at the bottom left corner in VS Code.
